## Running the Program

**main_loop.py** this is the main loop of the program and is primarily a "camera Loop".  It has ample opportunity to be simplified for better readability (and also better camera refresh).

**main.py** this is the main file used to run the program, and it enables you to switch between Testing, Calibration and Running the Pick and Place program easily as you work on your setup.
